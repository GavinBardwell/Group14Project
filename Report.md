# CSCE 435 Group project

## 0. Group number: 
14
## 1. Group members:
1. Gavin Bardwell
2. Tyson Long
3. Andrew Pribadi
4. Darwin White

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)
We will implement and analyze the effectiveness of four parallel sorting algorithms. 
We will communicate via text message   
### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

- Bitonic Sort:
- Sample Sort:
- Merge Sort:
- Radix Sort:

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
